ok guys so today i wanted to talk about what i consider to be some of the top e juice brands on the market.  

starting in no particular order with vapor fi, which is on most peoples top e juice brands list and here's why.  vapor fi offers one of the widest range of e liquids on the market.  with vapor fi you can a create your own blend with over 30,000 custom blends or if you lazy like me or just indecisive, you can pick from 115 pre-made flavors that they offer.   now one of the coolest things about vapor fi is that they offers different mixes of pg /vg with the standard e liquids using 70/30 or 50/50 blend, their reserve collection uses a 40/60 blend and their grand reserve collection uses a 30/70 blend.  so they have something for everyone.   4 flavors that i really like are the catch ya latte, which is from the grand reserve line, it's a 30/70 pg vg ration and smells and taste like freshly brewed espresso and is super awesome.  just a side note, the e juice from vapor fi's grand reserve line are a little more pricey currently costing $21.99, but i can tell a big difference in flavor compared to their other lines and these all come in 30ml bottles.  another flavor from the grand reserve line i like is called cloud candy.  vapor fi describes it as gummy bears swimming in a pool of gelatin under fluffy clouds of cotton candy and i must admit it's pretty sweet!  if you looking for something a little less pricey from the reserve line, black velvet is really good.  it's like  a cherry soft drink flavor, which i'm a big cherry coke, cherry dp, cherry any kind of soft drink kind of guy.  so this fields that void for me.  this one i got on the cheap off their site for $9.99.  and if i'm picking something from their  standard e liquid flavor line, i have to go with very vanilla.  i'm just a sucker for vanilla e juice.  all of vapor fi's e juices are 100% made in the usa, come with child proof bottle tops, and lot numbers so you can trace back the origins of your eliquid.  also vapor fi has registered all their formulas with the fda and their e-liquid lab is also registered with the fda as a tobacco manufacturer.  

which brings me to the v2 cigs.  v2 cigs is not really known as one of the top e juice brands mainly because they just don't have the selection.  their platinum e liquids come in 12 flavors including tobacco  flavors of v2 red, sahara and congress; the chill flavors of v2 menthol, peppermint and green tea menthol; and sweet flavors of grape, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, coffee and v2 cola.  
all the v2Â e liquidÂ bottles come with a clearly labelled batch number and expiration date. you can enter your batch number into their websiteÂ and it will send you a pdf of that batch report. unlike a lot of other e juiceÂ manufacturers v2 cigs clearly state exactly what is in their vape juice, including the flavors and sweeteners they use.   the 2 flavors that really stand out of me are v2 cigs vanilla e juice, which is really good and their menthol which is really similar to a marlboro menthol flavor.  v2's vape juice is comes in 25ml bottles and 50ml bottles.  the 25ml currently runs $16.95 and he 50ml cost $29.95 before using any kind of disconts.  

finally i wanted to talk about mig vapor.  mig vapor is starting to build it's reputation as one of the top e juice brands on the market.  they have numerous of lines of vape juice and they got something for everyone and they come in multiple sizes including 15ml at $10.95, 30ml at $17.95 , and even 120ml bottles at $69.95 and you can also pick different vg levels.   their 50/50 line is made for e cigarettes and vaporizer tanks.  they have one of the best tasting tobacco flavors with their ry tobacco, which has a soft gentle tobacco flavor.  and their red line e juice uses super high grade kosher vg.  this line is known for it's intense flavor and is pretty much designed for drippers and mod users.  mig vapor also like vapor fi offers a mix your own e juice option.  with their system you can add up to 75 flavors 5 times which comes out to almost endless possibilities.

_________________________________________________________________________ ðŸ”¥ sign up for my free 1hr training ðŸ”¥ 
this obscure scientific law teaches us a system to make money in any market - while lowering risk and protecting your money 

*click here to sign up*: https://go.1markmoss.com/bb-training __________________________________________________________________________ in this video we're going to look at why the fed can't just keep printing money forever, what risks it poses and what are the warning signs of when it's finally going to end. this is a massive bubble that's finally going to burst, we're gonna take a look at it 

this is a standalone video, but it's also a continuation of the previous video that i did, where i basically made the case that the markets, still have a ways to go. everyone's waiting for a crash. i know previously i said that the markets, still have a ways to go and as i said in that video, i can make the case, really good. either way, i can argue that the markets are going to keep going up for a while. i can argue that there shouldn't be crashing at any moment 

now in the other video. it was the bullish case why because still go up in this video, it's the bearish case. so, if you want to go see the other video you can go watch that here: https://youtu.be/dyuq3o6xobc 

for now, we're going to talk about when the bubble finally burst when the fed finally runs out of ammo. and of course, in this market that we're in, talks about it all the time we see this over and over where everybody basically says, don't fight the fed. 

and what does that mean the federal reserve, if so much money that they're printing they're pumping trillions of dollars in the market and it's pushing the market higher so it's kind of that old saying if you can't beat them, join them. 

and so don't try to beat the fed just bet with the fed, because the fed put all right now, the fed has made it abundantly clear that they do not want to let the markets crash. but at some point. they're going to run out of ammo. now, for now, as long as they keep hoping the market for liquidity in the markets should still keep going up. 

so if the feds gonna do that, like i said, then we just want to bet alongside them. so far it's been working. it's easy to see if we go all the way back you know just till 2008 to the great financial crash. you can see that the fed ballooned their balance sheets during the financial crash, and then you can see in the markets, how they shot higher from that stimulus.
