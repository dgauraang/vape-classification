0,Alex,2021-01-01 20:52:30.589330,2477,Vaping industry is booming,Jmf945iBP14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmf945iBP14,AP Archive,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTK-2W11Vh1V4uwofOfR4w,"(28 aug 2018) leadin:
vapers in the uk are hitting back at claims that inhaling e-liquid can lead to inflammation and chronic lung disease.
and with the number of vapers booming in the country, industry insiders and enthusiasts are keen to promote different ways of smoking e-cigarettes.
storyline: 
all sorts of smells fill the air in london's olympia venue. 
strawberry, lemon, cherry bakewell, french toast, coffee and even cannabis. 
an array of the uk's top vaping brands, from independent start-ups to tobacco-owned ones, have set up shop at the london vape show trying to lure in vapers with a never ending selection of hardware and vaping juice.
in this corner a group of reviewers, many of them youtube celebrity vapers, is tasked with voting for the best e-liquids and vaping accessories. 
nick bessette is a youtube reviewer who flew in for the show from the us.
  
 ""so when we test we are looking for quality, value for your money. when it comes to hardware we are looking for ease of use. you know, things like that. we are looking out for the consumers. we want people to be able to pick up a device and be able to use it straightaway without messing about with settings and stuff like that."" 
emerging after the introduction of a smoking ban in the uk in the late 2000s, the e-cigarette industry has boomed in recent years. 
public health england (phe) estimates that vaping helps at least 20-thousand people to successfully quit smoking every year, according to a report the agency published february 2017. 
phe went so far as to suggest that e-cigarettes should be prescribed by the british national health service, stating that vaping is at least 95 percent less harmful than smoking. 
when the european union's tobacco products directive (tbd) came into force in 2016, limits were placed on the production of vaping products. 
the burgeoning industry, mainly driven by independent entrepreneurs, had to adapt accordingly. 
brett heaps is a director of the online store eco vape. 
""when we started doing the new flavour creations for the legislation which is tobacco products directive we invented some new flavours to the industry, like out number one selling flavour 'prism' which you actually get different flavours every time you vape it cause it's such a complex mix. so you might get blackcurrant and then you start getting a bit of raspberry and then you get some, some other notes in there like vanilla.""
 eco vape sells between 20-thousand to 40-thousand e-liquid bottles a day, heaps says, to customers across the world. 
their latest venture is cannabis flavoured e-juice, mixed with desert flavours such as cherry bakewell.
director of uk vaping industry association john dunne says the uk has emerged as a market leader in the vaping industry, largely due to the government's favourable attitude towards e-cigarettes. 
""the uk is a little different than almost all of the other markets in the world. we have a regulatory environment and a government that is really pro-vaping. so we are seen as being the innovators i think of the vaping industry around the world. from a consumers' perspective, the industry is worth just under one (b) billion pounds (gbp) and growing. we have just under three (m) million vapers here in the uk and about 1.5 (m) million of those are full time vapers. so they don't use anything else except vaping products.""
in the event of a no-deal brexit, the uk will have the opportunity to review its legislation on tobacco and e-cigarette products.

the flysense™ solution is comprised of a cloud-based communications engine, incident management web portal, and multi-sensor device network capable of detecting vaping, smoke, and noise disturbances, that may suggest violence such as bullying or fighting, in real-time 24/7. 

when a sensor detects vaping signatures or decibel level anomalies caused by bullying or fighting, a zero-delay, location-specific alert notification is sent to by sms or email to designated school officials. 

advanced custom scheduling helps schools organize their staff to receive alert notifications on specific days of the week, during select time blocks, and for assigned devices to reduce the staffing burden for designated coverage areas and maximize opportunities for action.

real-time sensor data and customizable incident reports keep school teams informed on vaping activity and hotspots to target and reduce student vape use campus-wide.  

take control. clear the air on your campus with flysense. for more information visit www.sotertechnologies.com/flysense.
